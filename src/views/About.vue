          <h2>Solve intelligence. Use it to make the world a better place.</h2>
          <p>
            DeepMind is the world leader in artificial intelligence research and
            its application for positive impact.
          </p>
          <p>
            We’re on a scientific mission to push the boundaries of AI,
            developing programs that can learn to solve any complex problem
            without needing to be taught how.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we’re successful, we believe this will be one of the most
            important and widely beneficial scientific advances ever made,
            increasing our capacity to understand the mysteries of the universe
            and to tackle some of our most pressing real-world challenges. From
            climate change to the need for radically improved healthcare, too
            many problems suffer from painfully slow progress, their complexity
            overwhelming our ability to find solutions. With AI as a multiplier
            for human ingenuity, those solutions will come into reach. As in all
            long-term research efforts there are many hurdles ahead, but our
            team of renowned scientists and engineers is making exciting
            progress.
          </p>
          <p>
            By implementing our research in the field of games, a useful
            training ground, we were able to create a single program that taught
            itself how to play and win at 49 completely different Atari titles,
            with just raw pixels as input. And in a global first, our AlphaGo
            program took on the world’s best player at Go - one of the most
            complex and intuitive games ever devised, with more positions than
            there are atoms in the universe - and won. At the same time, our
            DeepMind Applied team is working with experts in different fields to
            make meaningful real-world breakthroughs. Our systems are having a
            major environmental impact by learning how to use vastly less energy
            in Google’s data centres, and we’re collaborating with clinicians in
            the UK’s National Health Service on delivering better care for
            conditions that affect millions of people worldwide. The progress
            we’ve made is in part down to our approach, which combines the
            long-term thinking and interdisciplinary collaboration of academia,
            the energy and focus of a technology start-up, and the social
            purpose of a team fervent about amazing impact.
          </p>
          <p>
            We set our own independent research agenda and roadmap as an
            autonomous company in the Alphabet group. We’re committed to openly
            publishing our work, with over 200 peer-reviewed papers, including
            in Nature and Science. Recognising that there are strong opinions on
            the safe and ethical use of AI, and that no one team has all the
            answers, we’re also deeply involved in working through these issues
            with wider academic and research communities. Our motivation in all
            we do is to maximise the positive and transformative impact of AI.
            We believe that AI should ultimately belong to the world, in order
            to benefit the many and not the few, and we’ll continue to research,
            publish and implement our work to that end.
          </p>
          <h2>The company</h2>
          <p>
            DeepMind was founded in London in 2010 and backed by some of the
            most successful technology entrepreneurs in the world. Having been
            acquired by Google in 2014, we are now part of the Alphabet group.
            We continue to be based in our hometown of London, with additional
            research centres in Edmonton and Montreal, Canada, and a DeepMind
            Applied team in Mountain View, California.
